# ShapeMatching
Shape/Digit Matching using Fourier Descriptor

Library: Python 2.7.1, numpy, OpenCV

By setting "manually" flag true, you can crop the templete region by mouse; if false, "6" in upper region will be templete.

The decimal figures printed on the image is Euclidean distance between templete and testee, smaller distance means better match.

The following picture is runnning result:
